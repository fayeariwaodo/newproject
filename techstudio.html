       <p>There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer because there is a consistent demand for developers who both write high-quality code and experienced problem solvers who can design creative solutions.</p>
        
       <p>The web and the applications built for it have transformed the way we do business globally, and is disrupting industries from education to manufacturing.</p>

       <h6 class="practical">What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have Upon Completion Of The Course?</h6>

       <p>By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most used web-based programming language â€“ JavaScript. Youâ€™ll have built several full-stack applications of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a development environment.</p>

       <p>Youâ€™ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. Youâ€™ll have gained foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web development â€“ managing complex data sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords, and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to scale.</p>
